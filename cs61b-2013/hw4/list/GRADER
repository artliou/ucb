Part II  (1 point)
------------------
Our ADT is not as well protected as we would like.  There are several ways by
which a hostile (or stupid) application can corrupt our DList (i.e., make it
violate an invariant) through method calls alone.  Describe one in a text file
named GRADER (which will be submitted with your code).  You should assume that
the application is NOT in the list package (which would be a remarkably
inappropriate place to put an application).

At the top of the GRADER file, include your name and cs61b login ID.

My Answer:
A possibility is that when a DListNode node, when passed as a parameter to some of the methods, might not ben part of this DList instance.:/
