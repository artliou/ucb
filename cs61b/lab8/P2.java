/*
You are to write a program to do this reconstruction on any such tree.
The input consists of one or more cases in free format. Each case consists of two non-empty
strings PRE and IN, representing the preorder traversal and inorder traversal of a non-empty
binary tree, and consisting of letters and digits. Case is significant.
For each test case, print the reconstructed treeâ€™s postorder traversal (left subtree, right subtree,
root), using the format shown in the example.*/

public class P2 {

    public static void main(String input) {
		String pre, String in;
		String pre = scanner.nextLine();
		
		System.out.println(in);
    }
